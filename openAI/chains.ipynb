      "Certainly! Based on your light skin tone and skinny body type, here are some clothing suggestions to flatter your frame and complement your complexion:\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Casual Look**\n",
      "1. **T-Shirts**: Opt for light or pastel-colored t-shirts (like baby blue, blush pink, or light yellow) to complement your skin tone. Slim-fit or tailored styles work well to enhance your frame.\n",
      "2. **Jeans**: Skinny or slim-fit jeans in medium-wash blue or black will elongate your legs and create a sleek silhouette.\n",
      "3. **Sneakers**: Go for classic white sneakers or neutral tones to maintain a clean and stylish appearance.\n",
      "4. **Jackets**: Lightweight bomber jackets or tailored denim jackets in earthy tones or navy blue will add structure without overwhelming your frame.\n",
      "5. **Hats**: A fedora or a classic beanie in neutral tones like beige, gray, or camel would suit your light skin tone beautifully.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Chic Winter Look**\n",
      "1. **Scarves**: Try chunky knit scarves in warm tones such as burgundy, mustard, or forest green to add texture and color near your face.\n",
      "2. **Belts**: A slim belt in a contrasting color can add definition to your waist and enhance your proportions.\n",
      "3. **Sunglasses**: Aviators or round sunglasses with gold or tortoiseshell frames will look stunning against your light skin tone.\n",
      "4. **Watches**: A minimalist watch with a light leather strap or metallic accents (like rose gold or silver) will complement your overall vibe.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Formal Look**\n",
      "1. **Gowns**: Choose gowns with sleek, straight cuts or flowy silhouettes. Light pastel shades or jewel tones (emerald, sapphire, or ruby) will pop beautifully against your complexion.\n",
      "2. **Ties**: For a classic formal look, skinny ties in solid colors or subtle patterns will balance your frame.\n",
      "3. **Blazers**: Single-breasted blazers in tailored cuts are perfect for your slim body type. Opt for muted or neutral colors like gray, navy, or beige.\n",
      "4. **Skirts**: A-line or pencil skirts in comfortable fabrics will highlight your waistline and create an elongated look.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Key Styling Tips**\n",
      "- Avoid overly baggy or boxy clothing, as they can overwhelm your frame.\n",
      "- Layering can add dimension without bulk—try pairing a fitted t-shirt with a cropped jacket or blazer.\n",
      "- Experiment with accessories like scarves, hats, and sunglasses to elevate your outfits and add personality.\n",
      "- Choose soft or muted shades to enhance your light skin tone, but don’t shy away from bold jewel tones for special occasions!\n",
